## How to Recall Which Loop to Use:

1. If iterating over an array or string: Use for...of.
2. If iterating over object properties: Use for...in.
3. If you know how many times you need to loop: Use for.
4. If looping until a condition changes (no set number of iterations): Use while.
5. If you need at least one iteration regardless of conditions: Use do...while.

## Picking the Right Loop for Your Code:

1. If you're working with arrays or iterables, use the for...of loop for simplicity and readability.
2. If you're dealing with objects, for...in is useful for iterating through properties.
3. If you need complete control over iteration logic (start, end, step), go for the for loop.
4. If the stopping condition depends on some dynamic factor, while and do...while loops are best.
